Create a structured narrative for a case involving suspected hepatic injury. Include:

- Patient Age: {patient_age}
- Suspect Drug: {drug}
- Reaction: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST)
- Lab Results: {lab_results}
- Onset Date: {onset_date}
- Seriousness: {seriousness}
- Relevant History: {medical_history}
- Outcome: {outcome}

Indicate whether Hy's Law criteria may be met. Discuss rechallenge or other interventions.

The narrative must include:
1. Baseline liver function status (if known)
2. Specific laboratory values and timing
3. Clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity (if any)
4. Assessment against Hy's Law criteria (ALT ≥3x ULN + Total bilirubin ≥2x ULN)
5. Drug discontinuation and dechallenge response
6. Any rechallenge information
7. Alternative causes ruled out
8. Current liver function status
