## 🎯 Design Philosophy

PV Sentinel was designed with **patient safety as the absolute priority**:

1. **Patient-Centric**: Patient voice and context are preserved at every step
2. **Transparent**: Complete audit trail and model version tracking
3. **Collaborative**: Multi-user workflows for safety assessments
4. **Compliant**: Built for GxP environments with regulatory requirements
5. **Private**: 100% local processing ensures data privacy
